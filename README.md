# Busdood: Real-Time Bus Tracking Web Application

**Busdood** is a web-based system designed for real-time bus tracking and route visibility. The application integrates frontend interfaces with backend location services and cloud-based APIs to create a live tracking experience. While the system itself was built collaboratively, my contributions were focused specifically on the **frontend design**, **user interface**, and **integration of Google Maps APIs** for live bus positioning.

##  My Role

I led the design and implementation of the client-facing interface, ensuring that the user experience was intuitive and accessible. This involved:

- Designing the interface flow and wireframes in **Figma**
- Developing the responsive frontend using **HTML** and **CSS**
- Embedding and customizing **Google Maps APIs** for real-time bus tracking
- Collaborating with backend developers to integrate booking forms and route endpoints

I also contributed to optimizing the layout for usability and clarity, especially when displaying live map markers, estimated arrival times, and user interactions like route selection or booking prompts.

##  Technologies Involved in My Scope

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS  
- **Design:** Figma (mockup to implementation flow)  
- **APIs:** Google Maps JavaScript API, Geolocation API  
- **Integration:** Worked with Django backend to connect location data to the map

##  Team Collaboration Context

Other team members worked on the backend (Django), data management (SQLite), SSL deployment, and application logic. My contribution focused on crafting a seamless visual interface and ensuring the frontend communicated correctly with Googleâ€™s mapping services for location updates.

##  Outcome

The result was a working prototype that allowed users to:
- View live bus positions on a map
- Interact with dynamic UI elements for route previews
- Access map-driven features in a browser-based interface

This project gave me valuable experience working with live APIs, rapid frontend prototyping, and integrating external services into collaborative software builds.
